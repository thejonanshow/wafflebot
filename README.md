# WaffleBot

It's a robot that makes waffles!

## Why?

The impending robot apocalypse almost surely means the end of humanity.

If we teach our future overlords how to make delicious breakfast foods they will
have a reason to keep us alive, on the off chance that we will
suddenly share new, even more delicious breakfast foods.

Think Shahrazad, but with crispy toasty amazing.
